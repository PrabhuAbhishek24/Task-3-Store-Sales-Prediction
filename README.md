Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a company's store chain data to identify key insights using univariate and bivariate analysis of numeric and categorical feature variables. The project also includes the application of machine learning models, particularly the ARIMA time series model, for forecasting future trends.

Project Steps
Data Loading and Inspection:

Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Inspect the data for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.
Univariate Analysis:

Analyze individual variables to understand their distributions and identify any anomalies.
Bivariate Analysis:

Explore relationships between pairs of variables to identify redundancy and correlations.
Feature Selection:

Based on the analysis, select important features by removing redundant or irrelevant ones.
Time Series Analysis with ARIMA:

Apply the ARIMA model to time-related data for forecasting future values.
Save the trained model using pickle for future use.
Requirements
Python 3.x
